## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to API" error**:

   - Ensure Kokoro-FastAPI Docker container is running
   - Check that port 8880 is accessible
   - Verify the API URL in extension settings

2. **"No readable content found"**:

   - The page might not have detectable article content
   - Try selecting specific text and using right-click context menu
   - Some sites with heavy JavaScript might not work properly

3. **Audio not playing**:
   - Chrome requires user interaction before playing audio
   - Try clicking on the page first, then using the extension
   - Check browser audio settings

### Docker Container Issues

Make sure your Kokoro-FastAPI container:

- Is running on the correct port (8880)
- Has the `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint available
- Supports the OpenAI-compatible API format

### Extension Permissions

The extension requires:

- `activeTab`: To read content from the current page
- `storage`: To save your settings
- `host_permissions`: To connect to your local API

## Development

### File Structure

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration
- `popup.html/js`: Extension popup interface
- `content.js/css`: Scripts injected into web pages
- `background.js`: Service worker for background tasks

### Customization

You can modify the extension by:

- Editing CSS for different visual styles
- Adjusting content detection selectors in `content.js`
- Adding new voice options in `popup.html`
- Modifying API request format for different TTS services
